    "\n",
    "#### Constructor\n",
    "Each HPacker object is utilized to reconstruct the side-chains of a single protein structure.\n",
    "Indeed, the constructor takes as required inputs a single PDB file, and a tuple of two paths pointing to the \"Initial Guess\" and the \"Refinement\" model directories. There are also several keyword arguments that govern pre-processing of the input structure, such as filtering out hydrogens and waters, and to remove sidechains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal Representation\n",
    "HPacker uses BioPython's PDB module to store and manipulate structures. HPacker stores three versions of the structure, as ```Bio.PDB.Structure``` objects:\n",
    "1. ```self.structure``` stores the *current* version of the structure, as it's being manipulated or reconstructed. Importantly, the backbone is never changed from the input.\n",
    "2. ```self.original_structure``` always stores the original structure passed to the constructor, after filtering but *before* removing side-chains, if the kwarg ```remove_sidechains``` is set to ```True```.\n",
    "3. ```self.copy_structure``` is a dummy structure used as a helper by the internal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residue sites are uniquely identified by residue IDs (```res_id```), each consisting of the Tuple (chain, resnum, icode).\n",
    "Individual Residue objects and amino-acid types (```resname```) can be accessed using the ```res_id``` within HPacker methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful methods\n",
    "Below is a list of *some* of the Hpacker methods that can be used to conveniently manipulate the internal representation of the protein structure\n",
    "- `get_res_ids()`\n",
